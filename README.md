# ONLINE-RETAIL-STORE-ANALYSIS
This project utilizes Power BI to analyze transactional data from an online retail store, providing insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and regional demand.
After importing the dataset into Power BI, data cleaning and transformation were performed using Power Query. This involved handling missing values, correcting date formats, removing duplicates, and standardizing fields to ensure data consistency.

##  Project  Objectives:
The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.
The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what’s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.
